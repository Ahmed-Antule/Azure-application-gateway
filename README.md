Summary: Deploying Azure Application Gateway for Load Balancing
In this project, I configured Azure Application Gateway to securely route traffic to a web application. The steps include:

Creating a Virtual Network (VNet) with two subnets:
One for the Application Gateway.
One for the Application (VMs hosting the website).
Deploying a Virtual Machine (VM) in the application subnet.
Connecting to the VM via RDP and installing the IIS server to host a dummy website.
Configuring the Application Gateway to route traffic to the IIS server.
Retrieving the Public IP of the Application Gateway to access the hosted website.
This setup enables secure, scalable, and efficient web traffic management using Azure's Layer 7 load balancing. ðŸš€

Step - 1
i. Create a virtual Network

ii. I have reserved 64 Ip address for the virtual machine and 64 for the application gateway

iii. Once the virtual Network is done , Lets create a VM , make sure you selected this ports.

iv. Deploy the VM in subnet that you created

Step- 2
i. Connect your VM with the RDP

Step - 3
i. Create Application Gateway, select your virtual network then click on Manage subnet configuration

ii. Click on + subnet , give the name and the left 64 ip address will be asign to this application gateway

iii. Now you can see your subnet is added

iv. Once the basic is configure lets configure the frontends, Just give the public ip name
